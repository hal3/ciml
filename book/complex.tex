\newthought{In the preceeding chapters,} you have learned all about a
very simple form of prediction: predicting bits.  In the real world,
however, we often need to predict much more complex objects.  You may
need to categorize a document into one of several categories: sports,
entertainment, news, politics, etc.  You may need to rank web pages or
ads based on relevance to a query.  You may need to simultaneously
classify a collection of objects, such as web pages, that have
important information in the links between them.  These problems are
all commonly encountered, yet fundamentally more complex than binary
classification.

In this chapter, you will learn how to use everything you already know
about binary classification to solve these more complicated problems.
You will see that it's relatively easy to think of a binary classifier
as a black box, which you can reuse for solving these more complex
problems.  This is a very useful abstraction, since it allows us to
reuse knowledge, rather than having to build new learning models and
algorithms from scratch.


\section{Learning with Imbalanced Data}

Your boss tells you to build a classifier that can identify fraudulent
transactions in credit card histories.  Fortunately, most transactions
are legitimate, so perhaps only $0.1\%$ of the data is a positive
instance.  The \concept{imbalanced data} problem refers to the fact
that for a large number of real world problems, the number of positive
examples is dwarfed by the number of negative examples (or vice
versa).  This is actually something of a misnomer: it is not the
\emph{data} that is imbalanced, but the \emph{distribution} from which
the data is drawn.  (And since the distribution is imbalanced, so must
the data be.)

Imbalanced data is a problem because machine learning algorithms are
too smart for your own good.  For most learning algorithms, if you
give them data that is $99.9\%$ negative and $0.1\%$ positive, they
will simply learn to always predict negative.  Why?  Because they are
trying to minimize error, and they can achieve $0.1\%$ error by doing
nothing!  If a teacher told you to study for an exam with $1000$
true/false questions and only one of them is true, it is unlikely you
will study very long.

Really, the problem is not with the data, but rather with the way that
you have defined the learning problem.  That is to say, what you care
about is \emph{not} accuracy: you care about something else.  If you
want a learning algorithm to do a reasonable job, you have to tell it
what you want!

Most likely, what you want is \emph{not} to optimize accuracy, but
rather to optimize some other measure, like f-score or AUC.  You want
your algorithm to make \emph{some} positive predictions, and simply
prefer those to be ``good.''  We will shortly discuss two heuristics
for dealing with this problem: subsampling and weighting.  In
subsampling, you \emph{throw out} some of you negative examples so
that you are left with a balanced data set ($50\%$ positive, $50\%$
negative).  This might scare you a bit since throwing out data seems
like a bad idea, but at least it makes learning much more efficient.
In weighting, instead of throwing out positive examples, we just given
them lower weight.  If you assign an \concept{importance weight} of
$0.00101$ to each of the positive examples, then there will be as much
\emph{weight} associated with positive examples as negative examples.

Before formally defining these heuristics, we need to have a mechanism
for formally defining supervised learning problems.  We will proceed
by example, using binary classification as the canonical learning
problem.

\learningproblem{Binary Classification}{
\item An input space $\cX$
\item An unknown distribution $\cD$ over $\cX \times \{ -1, +1 \}$
}{A function $f$ minimizing: $\Ep_{(\vx,y) \sim \cD} \big[ f(\vx) \neq y \big]$}

As in all the binary classification examples you've seen, you have
some input space (which has always been $\R^D$).  There is some
distribution that produces labeled examples over the input space.  You
do not have access to that distribution, but can obtain samples from
it.  Your goal is to find a classifier that minimizes error on that
distribution.

A small modification on this definition gives a $\al$-weighted
classification problem, where you believe that the positive class is
$\al$-times as important as the negative class.

\learningproblem{$\al$-Weighted Binary Classification}{
\item An input space $\cX$
\item An unknown distribution $\cD$ over $\cX \times \{ -1, +1 \}$
}{A function $f$ minimizing: $\Ep_{(\vx,y) \sim \cD} \Big[ \al^{y=1} \big[f(\vx) \neq y\big] \Big]$}

The objects given to you in weighted binary classification are
identical to standard binary classification.  The only difference is
that the \emph{cost} of misprediction for $y=+1$ is $\al$, while the
cost of misprediction for $y=-1$ is $1$.  In what follows, we assume
that $\al > 1$.  If it is not, you can simply swap the labels and use
$1/\al$.

The question we will ask is: suppose that I have a good algorithm for
solving the \lprob{Binary Classification} problem.  Can I turn that
into a good algorithm for solving the \lprob{$\al$-Weighted Binary
  Classification} problem?

\newalgorithm{complex:subsamplemap}
  {\FUN{SubsampleMap}(\VAR{$\cD^{\text{weighted}}$}, \VAR{$\al$})}
  {
\WHILE{\CON{true}}
\SAMPLE{$(\vx,y)$}{\VAR{$\cD^{\text{weighted}}$}}
\COMMENT{draw an example from the weighted distribution}
\SAMPLE{u}{uniform random variable in $[0,1]$}
\IF{\VAR{y} = \CON{+1} \OR \VAR{u} < $\frac 1 {\VARm{\al}}$}
\RETURN{$(\VARm{\vx},\VARm{y})$}
\ENDIF
\ENDWHILE
}

%\newalgorithm{complex:subsampletest}
%  {\FUN{SubsampleTest}(\FUN{$f^{\text{binary}}$}, \VAR{$\hat\vx$})}
%  {
%\RETURN \FUN{$f^{\text{binary}}$}(\VAR{$\hat\vx$})
%}

In order to do this, you need to define a \emph{transformation} that
maps a concrete weighted problem into a concrete unweighted problem.
This transformation needs to happen both at training time and at test
time (though it need not be the same transformation!).
Algorithm~\ref{alg:complex:subsampletrain} sketches a training-time
\concept{sub-sampling} transformation and
Algorithm~\ref{alg:complex:subsampletest} sketches a test-time
transformation (which, in this case, is trivial).  All the training
algorithm is doing is retaining all positive examples and a $1/\al$
fraction of all negative examples.  The algorithm is explicitly
turning the distribution over weighted examples into a (different)
distribution over binary examples.  A vanilla binary classifier is
trained on this \concept{induced distribution}.

Aside from the fact that this algorithm throws out a lot of data
(especially for large $\al$), it does seem to be doing a reasonable
thing.  In fact, from a \concept{reductions} perspective, it is an
optimal algorithm.  You can prove the following result:

\begin{theorem}[Subsampling Optimality] \label{thm:complex:subsample}
  Suppose the binary classifier trained in
  Algorithm~\ref{alg:complex:subsampletrain} achieves a binary error
  rate of $\ep$.  Then the error rate of the weighted predictor is
  equal to $\al\ep$.
\end{theorem}

This theorem states that if your binary classifier does well (on the
induced distribution), then the learned predictor will also do well
(on the original distribution).  Thus, we have successfully converted
a weighted learning problem into a plain classification problem!  The
fact that the error rate of the weighted predictor is exactly $\al$
times more than that of the unweighted predictor is unavoidable: the
error metric on which it is evaluated is $\al$ times bigger!

\thinkaboutit{Why is it unreasonable to expect to be able to achieve,
  for instance, an error of $\sqrt{\al} \ep$, or anything that is
  sublinear in $\al$?}

The proof of this theorem is so straightforward that we will prove it
here.  It simply involves some algebra on expected values.

\begin{myproof}{\ref{thm:complex:subsampletrain}}
  Let $\cD^w$ be the original distribution and let $\cD^b$ be the
  induced distribution.  Let $f$ be the binary classifier trained on
  data from $\cD^b$ that achieves a binary error rate of $\ep^b$ on
  that distribution.  We will compute the expected error $\ep^w$ of
  $f$ on the weighted problem:
  \begin{align}
    \ep^w 
    &= \Ep_{(\vx,y) \sim \cD^w} 
         \Big[ \al^{y=1} \big[f(\vx) \neq y\big] \Big] \\
    &= \sum_{\vx \in \cX} \sum_{y \in \pm 1}
         \cD^w(\vx,y) \al^{y=1} \big[f(\vx) \neq y\big] \\
%    &= \sum_{\vx \in \cX} \Big(
%         \cD^w(\vx,+1) \al \big[f(\vx) \neq +1\big] +
%         \cD^w(\vx,-1) \big[f(\vx) \neq -1\big] \Big) \\
    &= \al \sum_{\vx \in \cX} \Big(
         \cD^w(\vx,+1) \big[f(\vx) \neq +1\big] +
         \cD^w(\vx,-1) \frac 1 \al \big[f(\vx) \neq -1\big] \Big) \\
    &= \al \sum_{\vx \in \cX} \Big(
         \cD^b(\vx,+1) \big[f(\vx) \neq +1\big] +
         \cD^b(\vx,-1) \big[f(\vx) \neq -1\big] \Big) \\
    &= \al \Ep_{(\vx,y) \sim \cD^b} \big[f(\vx) \neq y\big] \\
    &= \al \ep^b
  \end{align}
And we're done!  (We implicitly assumed $\cX$ is discrete.  In the
case of continuous data, you need to replace all the sums over $\vx$
with integrals over $\vx$, but the result still holds.)
\end{myproof}

Instead of subsampling the low-cost class, you could alternatively
\concept{oversample} the high-cost class.  The easiest case is when
$\al$ is an integer, say $5$.  Now, whenever you get a positive point,
you include $5$ copies of it in the induced distribution.  Whenever
you get a negative point, you include a single copy.

\thinkaboutit{How can you handle non-integral $\al$, for instance $5.5$?}

This oversampling algorithm achieves exactly the same theoretical
result as the subsampling algorithm.  The main advantage to the
oversampling algorithm is that it does not throw out any data.  The
main advantage to the subsampling algorithm is that it is more
computationally efficient.

\thinkaboutit{Modify the proof of optimality for the subsampling
  algorithm so that it applies to the oversampling algorithm.}

You might be asking yourself: intuitively, the oversampling algorithm
seems like a much better idea than the subsampling algorithm, at least
if you don't care about computational efficiency.  But the theory
tells us that they are the same!  What is going on?  Of course the
theory isn't wrong.  It's just that the assumptions are effectively
different in the two cases.  Both theorems state that if you can get
error of $\ep$ on the binary problem, you automatically get error of
$\al\ep$ on the weighted problem.  But they do not say anything about
how possible it is to get error $\ep$ on the binary problem.  Since
the oversampling algorithm produces more data points than the
subsampling algorithm it is very concievable that you could get lower
binary error with oversampling than subsampling.

The primary drawback to oversampling is computational inefficiency.
However, for many learning algorithms, it is straightforward to
include \emph{weighted} copies of data points at no cost.  The idea is
to store only the unique data points and maintain a counter saying how
many times they are replicated.  This is not easy to do for the
perceptron (it can be done, but takes work), but it \emph{is} easy for
both decision trees and KNN.  For example, for decision trees (recall
Algorithm~\ref{alg:dt:train}), the only changes are to: (1) ensure
that line 1 computes the most frequent \emph{weighted} answer, and (2)
change lines 10 and 11 to compute weighted errors.

\thinkaboutit{Why is it hard to change the perceptron? (Hint: it has to
  do with the fact that perceptron is online.)}

\thinkaboutit{How would you modify KNN to take into account weights?}

\section{Multiclass Classification}

Multiclass classification is a natural extension of binary
classification.  The goal is still to assign a discrete label to
examples (for instance, is a document about entertainment, sports,
finance or world news?).  The difference is that you have $K>2$
classes to choose from.

\learningproblem{Multiclass Classification}{
\item An input space $\cX$ and number of classes $K$
\item An unknown distribution $\cD$ over $\cX \times [K]$
}{A function $f$ minimizing: $\Ep_{(\vx,y) \sim \cD} \big[f(\vx) \neq y\big]$}

Note that this is \emph{identical} to binary classification, except
for the presence of $K$ classes.  (In the above, $[K] =
\{1,2,3,\dots,K\}$.)  In fact, if you set $K=2$ you exactly recover
binary classification.

The game we play is the same: someone gives you a binary classifier
and you have to use it to solve the multiclass classification problem.
A very common approach is the \concept{one versus all} technique (also
called \concept{OVA} or \concept{one versus rest}).  To perform OVA,
you train $K$-many binary classifiers, $f_1, \dots, f_K$.  Each
classifier sees \emph{all} of the training data.  Classifier $f_i$
receives all examples labeled class $i$ as positives and all other
examples as negatives.  At test time, whichever classifier predicts
``positive'' wins, with ties broken randomly.

\thinkaboutit{Suppose that you have $N$ data points in $K$ classes,
  evenly divided.  How long does it take to train an OVA classifier,
  if the base binary classifier takes $\cO(N)$ time to train?  What if
  the base classifier takes $\cO(N^2)$ time?}

    D^{\text{multiclass}}$} so class \VAR{i} is positive and
  $\lnot$\VAR{i} is negative}

\ENDFOR
\RETURN{\VAR{$f_1$}, \dots, \VAR{$f_K$}}
}

  \COMMENT{initialize $K$-many scores to zero}

\SETST{y}{\FUN{$f_i$}(\VAR{$\hat\vx$})}
\SETST{score$_i$}{\VAR{$score_i$} + \VAR{y}}
\ENDFOR
\RETURN $\argmax_k$ \VAR{score$_k$}
}

The training and test algorithms for OVA are sketched in
Algorithms~\ref{alg:complex:ovatrain} and \ref{alg:complex:ovatest}.
In the testing procedure, the prediction of the $i$th classifier is
added to the overall score for class $i$.  Thus, if the prediction is
positive, class $i$ gets a vote; if the prdiction is negative,
everyone else (implicitly) gets a vote.  (In fact, if your learning
algorithm can output a confidence, as discussed in Section~\ref{}, you
can often do better by using the confidence as $y$, rather than a
simple $\pm1$.)

\thinkaboutit{Why would using a confidence help.}

OVA is very natural, easy to implement, and quite natural.  It also
works very well in practice, so long as you do a good job choosing a
good binary classification algorithm \emph{tuning} its hyperparameters
well.  Its weakness is that it can be somewhat brittle.  Intuitively,
it is not particularly robust to errors in the underlying classifiers.
If \emph{one} classifier makes a mistake, it eis possible that the
entire prediction is erroneous.  In fact, it is entirely possible that
\emph{none} of the $K$ classifiers predicts positive (which is
actually the worst-case scenario from a theoretical perspective)!
This is made explicit in the OVA error bound below.

\begin{theorem}[OVA Error Bound] \label{thm:complex:ova} Suppose the
  average binary error of the $K$ binary classifiers is $\ep$.  Then
  the error rate of the OVA multiclass predictor is \emph{at most}
  $(K-1) \ep$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{myproof}{\ref{thm:complex:ova}}
  The key question is erroneous predictions from the binary
  classifiers lead to multiclass errors.  We break it down into false
  negatives (predicting -1 when the truth is +1) and false positives
  (predicting +1 when the truth is -1).

  When a false negative occurs, then the testing procedure chooses
  randomly between available options, which is all labels.  This gives
  a $(K-1)/K$ probability of multiclass error.  Since only \emph{one}
  binary error is necessary to make this happen, the \emph{efficiency}
  of this error mode is $[ (K-1) / K ] / 1 = (K-1) / K$.

  Multiple false positives can occur simultaneously.  Suppose there
  are $m$ false positives.  If there is simultaneously a false
  negative, the error is $1$.  In order for this to happen, there have
  to be $m+1$ errors, so the efficiency is $1/(M+1)$.  In the case
  that there is not a simultaneous false negative, the error
  probability is $m/(m+1)$.  This requires $m$ errors, leading to an
  efficiency of $1/(m+1)$.

  The worse case, therefore, is the false negative case, which gives
  an efficiency of $(K-1)/K$.  Since we have $K$-many opportunities to
  err, we multiply this by $K$ and get a bound of $(K-1) \ep$.
\end{myproof}

The constants in this are relatively unimportant: the aspect that
matters is that this scales \emph{linearly} in $K$.  That is, as the
number of classes grows, so does your expected error.

To develop alternative approaches, a useful way to think about turning
multiclass classification problems into binary classification problems
is to think of them like tournaments (football, soccer--aka football,
cricket, tennis, or whatever appeals to you).  You have $K$ teams
entering a tournament, but unfortunately the sport they are playing
only allows two to compete at a time.  You want to set up a way of
pairing the teams and having them compete so that you can figure out
which team is best.  In learning, the teams are now the classes and
you're trying to figure out which class is best.\sidenote{The sporting
  analogy breaks down a bit for OVA: $K$ games are played, wherein
  each team will play simultaneously against all other teams.}

One natural approach is to have every team compete against every other
team.  The team that wins the majority of its matches is declared the
winner.  This is the \concept{all versus all} (or \concept{AVA})
approach (sometimes called \concept{all pairs}).  The most natural way
to think about it is as training $K \choose 2$ classifiers.  Say
$f_{ij}$ for $1 \leq i < j \leq k$ is the classifier that pits class
$i$ against class $j$.  This classifier receives all of the class $i$
examples as ``positive'' and all of the class $j$ examples as
``negative.''  When a test point arrives, it is run through all
$f_{ij}$ classifiers.  Every time $f_{ij}$ predicts positive, class
$i$ gets a point; otherwise, class $j$ gets a point.  After running
all $K \choose 2$ classifiers, the class with the most votes wins.

\thinkaboutit{Suppose that you have $N$ data points in $K$ classes,
  evenly divided.  How long does it take to train an AVA classifier,
  if the base binary classifier takes $\cO(N)$ time to train?  What if
  the base classifier takes $\cO(N^2)$ time?  How does this compare to
  OVA?}

The training and test algorithms for AVA are sketched in
Algorithms~\ref{alg:complex:avatrain} and \ref{alg:complex:avatest}.
In theory, the AVA mapping is more complicated than the weighted
binary case.  The result is stated below, but the proof is omitted.

\begin{theorem}[AVA Error Bound] \label{thm:complex:ava} Suppose the
  average binary error of the $K \choose 2$ binary classifiers is
  $\ep$.  Then the error rate of the AVA multiclass predictor is
  \emph{at most} $2(K-1) \ep$.
\end{theorem}

\thinkaboutit{The bound for AVA is $2(K-1)\ep$; the bound for OVA is
  $(K-1)\ep$.  Does this mean that OVA is necessarily better than AVA?
  Why or why not?}


\Figure{complex_badova}{data set on which OVA will do terribly with
  linear classifiers}

\thinkaboutit{Consider the data in Figure~\ref{fig:complex_badova} and
  assume that you are using a perceptron as the base classifier.  How
  well will OVA do on this data?  What about AVA?}

At this point, you might be wondering if it's possible to do better
than something linear in $K$.  Fortunately, the answer is yes!  The
solution, like so much in computer science, is divide and conquer.
The idea is to construct a \emph{binary tree} of classifiers.  The
leaves of this tree correspond to the $K$ labels.  Since there are
only $\log_2 K$ decisions made to get from the root to a leaf, then
there are only $\log_2 K$ chances to make an error.

\Figure{complex_tree}{example classification tree for $K=8$}

An example of a classification tree for $K=8$ classes is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:complex_tree}.  At the root, you distinguish between
classes $\{1,2,3,4\}$ and classes $\{5,6,7,8\}$.  This means that you
will train a binary classifier whose positive examples are all data
points with multiclass label $\{1,2,3,4\}$ and whose negative examples
are all data points with multiclass label $\{5,6,7,8\}$.  Based on
what decision is made by this classifier, you can walk down the
appropriate path in the tree.  When $K$ is not a powwr of $2$, the
tree will not be full.  This classification tree algorithm achieves
the following bound.

\begin{theorem}[Tree Error Bound] \label{thm:complex_tree} Suppose the
  average binary classifiers error is $\ep$.  Then the error rate of
  the tree classifier is \emph{at most} $\ceil{\log_2 K} \ep$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{myproof}{\ref{thm:complex_tree}}
  A multiclass error is made if any classifier on the path from the
  root to the correct leaf makes an error.  Each has probability $\ep$
  of making an error and the path consists of at most $\ceil{\log_2
    K}$ binary decisions.
\end{myproof}

One think to keep in mind with tree classifiers is that you have
control over how the tree is defined.  In OVA and AVA you have no say
in what classification problems are created.  In tree classifiers, the
only thing that matters is that, at the root, half of the classes are
considered positive and half are considered negative.  You want to
split the classes in such a way that this classification decision is
as easy as possible.  You can use whatever you happen to know about
your classification problem to try to separate the classes out in a
reasonable way.

Can you do better than $\ceil{\log_2 K}\ep$?  It turns out the answer
is yes, but the algorithms to do so are relatively complicated.  You
can actually do as well as $2\ep$ using the idea of error-correcting
tournaments.  Moreover, you can prove a \emph{lower bound} that states
that the best you could possible do is $\ep/2$.  This means that
error-correcting tournaments are at most a factor of four worse than
optimal.

\section{Ranking}

You start a new web search company called Goohooing.  Like other
search engines, a user inputs a query and a set of documents is
retrieved.  Your goal is to rank the resulting documents based on
relevance to the query.  The ranking problem is to take a collection
of items and sort them according to some notion of preference.  One of
the trickiest parts of doing ranking through learning is to properly
define the loss function.  Toward the end of this section you will see
a very general loss function, but before that let's consider a few
special cases.

Continuing the web search example, you are given a collection of
queries.  For each query, you are also given a collection of
documents, together with a desired ranking over those documents.  In
the following, we'll assume that you have $N$-many queries and for
each query you have $M$-many documents.  (In practice, $M$ will
probably vary by query, but for ease we'll consider the simplified
case.)  The goal is to train a binary classifier to predict a
\concept{preference function}.  Given a query $q$ and two documents
$d_i$ and $d_j$, the classifier should predict whether $d_i$ should be
preferred to $d_j$ with respect to the query $q$.

As in all the previous examples, there are two things we have to take
care of: (1) how to train the classifier that predicts preferences;
(2) how to turn the predicted preferences into a ranking.  Unlike the
previous examples, the second step is somewhat complicated in the
ranking case.  This is because we need to predict an entire ranking of
a large number of documents, somehow assimilating the preference
function into an overall permutation.

For notationally simplicity, let $\vx_{nij}$ denote the features
associated with comparing document $i$ to document $j$ on query $n$.
Training is fairly straightforward.  For every $n$ and every pair $i
\neq j$, we will create a binary classification example based on
features $\vx_{nij}$.  This example is positive if $i$ is preferred to
$j$ in the true ranking.  It is negative if $j$ is preferred to $i$.
(In some cases the true ranking will not express a preference between
two objects, in which case we exclude the $i,j$ and $j,i$ pair from
training.)

Now, you might be tempted to evaluate the classification performance
of this binary classifier on its own.  The problem with this approach
is that it's impossible to tell---just by looking at its output on one
$i,j$ pair---how good the overall ranking is.  This is because there
is the intermediate step of turning these pairwise predictions into a
coherent ranking.  What you need to do is measure how well the ranking
based on your predicted preferences compares to the true ordering.
Algorithms~\ref{alg:complex:naiveranktrain} and
\ref{alg:complex:naiveranktest} show naive algorithms for training and
testing a ranking function.

These algorithms actually work quite well in the case of
\concept{bipartite ranking problems}.  A bipartite ranking problem is
one in which you are only ever trying to predict a binary response,
for instance ``is this document relevant or not?'' but are being
evaluated according to a metric like \concept{AUC}.  This is
essentially because the only goal in bipartite problems to to ensure
that all the relevant documents are ahead of all the irrelevant
documents.  There is no notion that one relevant document is
\emph{more relevant} than another.

For non-bipartite ranking problems, you can do better.  First, when
the preferences that you get at training time are more nuanced than
``relevant or not,'' you can incorporate these preferences at training
time.  Effectively, you want to give a higher weight to binary
problems that are very different in terms of perference than others.
Second, rather than producing a list of scores and then calling an
arbitrary sorting algorithm, you can actually use the preference
function as the sorting function inside your own implementation of
quicksort.  

We can now formalize the problem.  Define a ranking as a function
$\si$ that maps the objects we are ranking (documents) to the desired
position in the list, $1, 2, \dots M$.  If $\si_u < \si_v$ then $u$
is preferred to $v$ (i.e., appears earlier on the ranked document
list).  Given data with observed rankings $\si$, our goal is to learn
to predict rankings for new objects, $\hat\si$.  We define $\Si_M$ as
the set of all ranking functions over $M$ objects.  We also wish to
express the fact that making a mistake on some pairs is worse than
making a mistake on others.  This will be encoded in a cost function
$\om$ (omega), where $\om(i,j)$ is the cost for accidentally putting
something in position $j$ when it should have gone in position $i$.
To be a valid cost function valid, $\om$ must be (1) symmetric, (2)
monotonic and (3) satisfy the triangle inequality.  Namely: (1)
$\om(i,j) = \om(j,i)$; (2) if $i<j<k$ or $i>j>k$ then $\om(i,j) \leq
\om(i,k)$; (3) $\om(i,j) + \om(j,k) \geq \om(i,k)$.  With these
definitions, we can properly define the ranking problem.

\learningproblem{$\om$-Ranking}{
\item An input space $\cX$
\item An unknown distribution $\cD$ over $\cX \times \Si_M$
}{A function $f : \cX \fto \Si_M$ minimizing:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:complex:rank}
  \Ep_{(\vx,\si) \sim \cD} \left[
%    {M \choose 2}^{-1}
    \sum_{u \neq v}
      [    \si_u <     \si_v]~
      [\hat\si_v < \hat\si_u]~
      \om( \si_u, \si_v )~
  \right]
\end{equation}
where $\hat\si = f(\vx)$
}

In this definition, the only complex aspect is the loss
function~\ref{eq:complex:rank}.  This loss sums over all pairs of
objects $u$ and $v$.  If the true ranking ($\si$) prefers $u$ to $v$,
but the predicted ranking ($\hat\si$) prefers $v$ to $u$, then you
incur a cost of $\om(\si_u,\si_v)$.

Depending on the problem you care about, you can set $\om$ to many
``standard'' options.  If $\om(i,j) = 1$ whenever $i \neq j$, then you
achieve the Kemeny distance measure, which simply counts the number of
pairwise misordered items.  In many applications, you may only care
about getting the top $K$ predictions correct.  For instance, your web
search algorithm may only display $K=10$ results to a user.  In this
case, you can define:
\begin{equation}
\om(i,j) = \brack{
  1 & \text{if } \min\{i,j\} \leq K \text{ and } i \neq j \\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
}
\end{equation}
In this case, only errors in the top $K$ elements are penalized.
Swapping items $55$ and $56$ is irrelevant (for $K<55$).

Finally, in the bipartite ranking case, you can express the
\concept{area under the curve} (\concept{AUC}) metric as:
\begin{equation}
\om(i,j) =
  \frac {{M \choose 2}} {M^+(M-M^+)}
    \times
    \brack{1 & \text{if } i \leq M^+ \text{ and } j > M^+ \\
           1 & \text{if } j \leq M^+ \text{ and } i > M^+ \\
           0 & \text{otherwise} }
\end{equation}
Here, $M$ is the total number of objects to be ranked and $M^+$ is the
number that are actually ``good.''  (Hence, $M-M^+$ is the number that
are actually ``bad,'' since this is a bipartite problem.)  You are
only penalized if you rank a good item in position greater than $M^+$
or if you rank a bad item in a position less than or equal to $M^+$.

}

In order to \emph{solve} this problem, you can follow a recipe similar
to the naive approach sketched earlier.  At training time, the biggest
change is that you can \emph{weight} each training example by how bad
it would be to mess it up.  This change is depicted in
Algorithm~\ref{alg:complex:ranktrain}, where the binary classiciation
data has \emph{weights} \VAR{$w$} provided for saying how important a
given example is.  These weights are derived from the cost function
$\om$.

At test time, instead of predicting scores and then sorting the list,
you essentially run the quicksort algorith, using $f$ as a comparison
function.  At each step in Algorithm~\ref{alg:complex:ranktest}, a
pivot $p$ is chosen.  Every other object $u$ is compared to $p$ using
$f$.  If $f$ thinks $u$ is better, then it is sorted on the left;
otherwise it is sorted on the right.  There is one major difference
between this algorithmand quicksort: the comparison function is
allowed to be \emph{probabilistic}.  If $f$ outputs probabilities, for
instance it predicts that $u$ has an $80\%$ probability of being
better than $p$, then it puts it on the left with $80\%$ probability
and on the right with $20\%$ probability.  (The pseudocode is written
in such a way that even if $f$ just predicts $-1,+1$, the algorithm
still works.)

This algorithm is better than the naive algorithm in at least two
ways.  First, it only makes $\cO(M\log_2 M)$ calls to $f$ (in
expectation), rather than $\cO(M^2)$ calls in the naive case.  Second,
it achieves a better error bound, shown below:

\begin{theorem}[Rank Error Bound] \label{thm:complex:rank} Suppose the
  average binary error of $f$ is $\ep$.  Then the ranking algorithm
  achieves a test error of at most $2\ep$ in the general case, and
  $\ep$ in the bipartite case.
\end{theorem}




\section{Collective Classification}

\Figure{complex_face}{example face finding image and pixel mask}

You are writing new software for a digital camera that does face
identification.  However, instead of simply finding a bounding box
around faces in an image, you must predict where a face is \emph{at
  the pixel level.}  So your input is an image (say, $100\times 100$
pixels: this is a really low resolution camera!) and your output is a
set of $100\times 100$ binary predictions about each pixel.  You are
given a large collection of training examples.  An example
input/output pair is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:complex_face}.

Your first attempt might be to train a binary classifier to predict
whether pixel $(i,j)$ is part of a face or not.  You might feed in
features to this classifier about the RGB values of pixel $(i,j)$ as
well as pixels in a window arround that.  For instance, pixels in the
region $\{(i+k,j+l) : k \in [-5,5], l \in [-5,5]\}$.

\Figure{complex_facebad}{bad pixel mask for previous image}

You run your classifier and notice that it predicts weird things, like
what you see in Figure~\ref{fig:complex_facebad}.  You then realize
that predicting each pixel independently is a bad idea!  If pixel
$(i,j)$ is part of a face, then this significantly increases the
chances that pixel $(i+1,j)$ is also part of a face.  (And similarly
for other pixels.)  This is a \concept{collective classification}
problem because you are trying to predict multiple, correlated objects
at the same time.

\thinkaboutit{Similar problems come up all the time.  Cast the
  following as collective classification problems: web page
  categorization; labeling words in a sentence as noun, verb,
  adjective, etc.; finding genes in DNA sequences; predicting the
  stock market.}

The most general way to formulate these problems is as (undirected)
\concept{graph} prediction problems.  Our input now takes the form of
a graph, where the vertices are input/output pairs and the edges
represent the correlations among the putputs.  (Note that edges do not
need to express correlations among the inputs: these can simply be
encoded on the nodes themselves.)  For example, in the face
identification case, each pixel would correspond to an vertex in the
graph.  For the vertex that corresponds to pixel $(5,10)$, the input
would be whatever set of features we want about that pixel (including
features about neighboring pixels).  There would be edges between that
vertex and (for instance) vertices $(4,10)$, $(6,10)$, $(5,9)$ and
$(5,11)$.  If we are predicting one of $K$ classes at each vertex,
then we are given a graph whose vertices are labeled by pairs $(\vx,k)
\in \cX \times [K]$.  We will write $\cG(\cX\times[K])$ to denote the
set of all such graphs.  A graph in this set is denoted as $G=(V,E)$
with vertices $V$ and edges $E$.  Our goal is a function $f$ that
takes as input a graph from $\cG(\cX)$ and predicts a label from $[K]$
for each of its vertices.

\thinkaboutit{Formulate the example problems above as graph prediction
  problems.}

\learningproblem{Collective Classification}{
\item An input space $\cX$ and number of classes $K$
\item An unknown distribution $\cD$ over $\cG(\cX\times[K])$
}{A function $f : \cG(\cX) \fto \cG([K])$ minimizing: 
$\Ep_{(V,E) \sim \cD} \left[
  \sum_{v \in V} \big[ \hat y_v \neq y_v \big]
  \right]$, where $y_v$ is the label associated with vertex $v$ in $G$
  and $\hat y_v$ is the label predicted by $f(G)$.}

In collective classification, you would like to be able to use the
labels of neighboring vertices to help predict the label of a given
vertex.  For instance, you might want to add features to the predict
of a given vertex based on the labels of each neighbor.  At training
time, this is easy: you get to see the true labels of each neighbor.
However, at test time, it is much more difficult: you are, yourself,
predicting the labels of each neighbor.

This presents a chicken and egg problem.  You are trying to predict a
collection of labels.  But the prediction of each label depends on the
prediction of other labels.  If you remember from before, a general
solution to this problem is iteration: you can begin with some
guesses, and then try to improve these guesses over time.
\sidenote{Alternatively, the fact that we're using a graph might
  scream to you ``dynamic programming.''  Rest assured that you can do
  this too: skip forward to Chapter~\ref{sec:srl} for lots more detail
  here!}

\Figure{complex_stacking}{a charicature of how stacking works}

This is the idea of \concept{stacking} for solving collective
classification (see Figure~\ref{fig:complex_stacking}.  You can train
$5$ classifiers.  The first classifier \emph{just} predicts the value
of each pixel independently, like in Figure~\ref{fig:complex_facebad}.
This doesn't use any of the graph structure at all.  In the second
level, you can repeat the classification.  However, you can use the
outputs from the first level as initial guesses of labels.  In
general, for the $K$th level in the stack, you can use the inputs
(pixel values) as well as the predictions for all of the $K-1$
previous levels of the stack.  This means training $K$-many binary
classifiers based on different feature sets.

The prediction technique for stacking is sketched in
Algorithm~\ref{alg:complex:stacktest}.  This takes a list of $K$
classifiers, corresponding to each level in the stack, and an input
graph $G$.  The variable $\hat Y_{k,v}$ stores the prediction of
classifier $k$ on vertex $v$ in the graph.  You first predict every
node in the vertex using the first layer in the stack, and no
neighboring information.  For the rest of the layers, you add on
features to each node based on the predictions made by lower levels in
the stack for neighboring nodes ($\cN(u)$ denotes the neighbors of
$u$).

The training procedure follows a similar scheme, sketched in
Algorithm~\ref{alg:complex:stacktrain}.  It largely follows the same
schematic as the prediction algorithm, but with training fed in.
After the classifier for the $k$ level has been trained, it is used to
predict labels on every node in the graph.  These labels are used by
later levels in the stack, as features.

One thing to be aware of is that \FUN{MulticlassTrain} could
conceivably overfit its training data.  For example, it is possible
that the first layer might actually achieve $0\%$ error, in which case
there is no reason to iterate.  But at test time, it will probably
\emph{not} get $0\%$ error, so this is misleading.  There are (at
least) two ways to address this issue.  The first is to use
cross-validation during training, and to use the predictions obtained
during cross-validation as the predictions from \concept{StackTest}.
This is typically very safe, but somewhat expensive.  The alternative
is to simply \emph{over-regularize} your training algorithm.  In
particular, instead of trying to find hyperparameters that
get the \emph{best} development data performance, try to find
hyperparameters that make your \emph{training} performance
approximately equal to your \emph{development} performance.  This will
ensure that your predictions at the $k$th layer are indicative of how
well the algorithm will actually do at test time.
