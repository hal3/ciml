\newthought{Groups of people can often make better decisions} than
individuals, especially when group members each come in with their own
biases.  The same is true in machine learning.  Ensemble methods are
learning models that achieve performance by combining the opinions of
multiple learners.  In doing so, you can often get away with using
much \emph{simpler} learners and still achieve great performance.
Moreover, ensembles are inherantly parallel, which can make them much
more efficient at training and test time, if you have access to
multiple processors.

In this chapter, you will learn about various ways of combining
\koncept{base learners}{base learner} into
\koncept{ensembles}{ensemble}.  One of the shocking results we will
see is that you can take a learning model that only ever does slightly
better than chance, and turn it into an arbitrarily good learning
model, though a technique known as \concept{boosting}.  You will also
learn how ensembles can decrease the variance of predictors as well as
perform regularization.

\section{Voting Multiple Classifiers}

All of the learning algorithms you have seen so far are
deterministic.  If you train a decision tree multiple times on the
same data set, you will always get the same tree back.  In order to
get an effect out of voting multiple classifiers, they need to
differ.  There are two primary ways to get variability.  You can
either change the learning algorithm or change the data set.

%TODO: need to talk about bias/variance before this point

Building an emsemble by training different classifiers is the most
straightforward approach.  As in single-model learning, you are given
a data set (say, for classification).  Instead of learning a single
classifier (e.g., a decision tree) on this data set, you learn multiple
different classifiers.  For instance, you might train a decision tree,
a perceptron, a $K$NN, and multiple neural networks with different
architectures.  Call these classifiers $f_1, \dots, f_M$.  At test
time, you can make a prediction by \emph{voting}.  On a test example
$\hat x$, you compute $\hat y_1 = f_1(\hat x)$, $\dots$, $\hat y_M =
f_M(\hat x)$.  If there are more $+1$s in the list $\langle y_1,
\dots, y_M$ then you predict $+1$; otherwise you predict $-1$.

The main advantage of ensembles of different classifiers is that it is
unlikely that all classifiers will make the same mistake.  In fact, as
long as every error is made by a minority of the classifiers, you will
achieve optimal classification!  Unfortunately, the inductive biases
of different learning algorithms are highly correlated.  This means
that different algorithms are prone to similar types of errors.  In
particular, ensembles tend to reduce the \concept{variance} of
classifiers.  So if you have a classification algorithm that tends to
be very sensitive to small changes in the training data, ensembles are
likely to be useful.

\thinkaboutit{Which of the classifiers you've learned about so far
  have high variance?}

Note that the voting scheme naturally extends to multiclass
classification.  However, it does not make sense in the contexts of
regression, ranking or collective classification.  This is because you
will rarely see the same exact output predicted twice by two different
regression models (or ranking models or collective classification
models).  For regression, a simple solution is to take the \emph{mean}
or \emph{median} prediction from the different models.  For ranking
and collective classification, different approaches are required.

Instead of training different types of classifiers on the same
data set, you can train a single type of classifier (e.g., decision
tree) on multiple data sets.  The question is: where do these multiple
data sets come from, since you're only given one at training time?

One option is to fragment your original data set.  For instance, you
could break it into 10 pieces and build decision trees on each of
these pieces individually.  Unfortunately, this means that each
decision tree is trained on only a very small part of the entire
data set and is likely to perform poorly.

%TODO: be sure iid is defined

\Figure{ens_resample}{picture of sampling with replacement}

A better solution is to use \concept{bootstrap resampling}.  This is a
technique from the statistics literature based on the following
observation.  The data set we are given, $D$, is a sample drawn
i.i.d. from an unknown distribution $\cD$.  If we draw a \emph{new}
data set $\tilde D$ by random sampling from $D$ with
replacement\footnote{To sample with replacement, imagine putting all
  items from $D$ in a hat.  To draw a single sample, pick an element
  at random from that hat, write it down, and then \emph{put it
    back}.}, then $\tilde D$ is \emph{also} a sample from $\cD$.
Figure~\ref{fig:ens_resample} shows the process of bootstrap
resampling of ten objects.

Applying this idea to ensemble methods yields a technique known as
\concept{bagging}.  You start with a single data set $D$ that contains
$N$ training examples.  From this single data set, you create $M$-many
``bootstrapped training sets'' $\tilde D_1, \dots \tilde D_M$.  Each
of these bootstrapped sets also contains $N$ training examples, drawn
randomly from $D$ with replacement.  You can then train a decision
tree (or other model) seperately on each of these data sets to obtain
classifiers $f_1, \dots, f_M$.  As before, you can use these
classifiers to vote on new test points.

Note that the bootstrapped data sets will be similar.  However, they
will not be \emph{too} similar.  For example, if $N$ is large then the
number of examples that are not present in any particular bootstrapped
sample is relatively large.  The probability that the first training
example is not selected once is $(1- 1/N)$.  The probability that it
is not selected at all is $(1 - 1/N)^N$.  As $N \rightarrow \infty$,
this tends to $1/e \approx 0.3679$.  (Already for $N=1000$ this is correct
to four decimal points.)  So only about $63\%$ of the original
training examples will be represented in any given bootstrapped set.

\Figure{ens_overfitting}{graph depicting overfitting using regularization versus bagging}

Since bagging tends to reduce \emph{variance}, it provides an
alternative approach to regularization.  That is, even if each of the
learned classifiers $f_1, \dots, f_M$ are individually overfit, they
are likely to be overfit to different things.  Through voting, you are
able to overcome a significant portion of this overfitting.
Figure~\ref{ens_overfitting} shows this effect by comparing
regularization via hyperparameters to regularization via bagging.

\section{Boosting Weak Learners}

Boosting is the process of taking a crummy learning algorithm
(technically called a \concept{weak learner}) and turning it into a
great learning algorithm (technically, a \concept{strong learner}).
Of all the ideas that originated in the theoretical machine learning
community, boosting has had---perhaps---the greatest practical impact.
The idea of boosting is reminiscent of what you (like me!)  might have
thought when you first learned about file compression.  If I compress
a file, and then re-compress it, and then re-compress it, eventually
I'll end up with a final that's only one byte in size!

To be more formal, let's define a \concept{strong learning algorithm}
$\cL$ as follows.  When given a desired error rate $\ep$, a failure
probability $\de$ and access to ``enough'' labeled examples from some
distribution $\cD$, then, with high probability (at least $1-\de$),
$\cL$ learns a classifier $f$ that has error at most $\ep$.  This is
precisely the definition of \concept{PAC} learning that you learned
about in Chapter~\ref{sec:thy}.  Building a strong learning algorithm
might be difficult.  We can as if, instead, it is possible to build a
\concept{weak learning algorithm} $\cW$ that only has to achieve an
error rate of $49\%$, rather than some arbitrary user-defined
parameter $\ep$.  ($49\%$ is arbitrary: anything strictly less than
$50\%$ would be fine.)

Boosting is more of a ``framework'' than an algorithm.  It's a
framework for taking a weak learning algorithm $\cW$ and turning it
into a strong learning algorithm.  The particular boosting algorithm
discussed here is \concept{AdaBoost}, short for ``adaptive boosting
algorithm.''  AdaBoost is famous because it was one of the first
%TODO: fix this: it's not entirely true
\emph{practical} boosting algorithms: it runs in polynomial time and
does not require you to define a large number of hyperparameters.  It
gets its name from the latter benefit: it automatically \emph{adapts}
to the data that you give it.

The intuition behind AdaBoost is like studying for an exam by using
a past exam.  You take the past exam and grade yourself.  The
questions that you got right, you pay less attention to.  Those that
you got \emph{wrong}, you study more.  Then you take the exam again
and repeat this process.  You continually \emph{down-weight} the
importance of questions you routinely answer correctly and
\emph{up-weight} the importance of questions you routinely answer
incorrectly.  After going over the exam multiple times, you hope to
have mastered everything.

}

The precise AdaBoost training algorithm is shown in
Algorithm~\ref{alg:ens:adaboost}.  The basic functioning of the
algorithm is to maintain a \emph{weight distribution} $\vec d$, over
data points.  A weak learner, $\FUNm{f\kth}$ is trained on this
weighted data.  (Note that we implicitly assume that our weak learner
can accept weighted training data, a relatively mild assumption that
is nearly always true.)  The (weighted) error rate of $\FUNm{f\kth}$
is used to determine the \emph{adaptive parameter} $\al$, which
controls how ``important'' $\FUNm{f\kth}$ is.  As long as the weak
learner does, indeed, achieve $<50\%$ error, then $\al$ will be
greater than zero.  As the error drops to zero, $\al$ grows without
bound.

\thinkaboutit{What happens if the weak learning assumption is violated
  and $\hat\ep$ is equal to $50\%$?  What if it is worse than $50\%$?
  What does this mean, in practice?}

After the adaptive parameter is computed, the weight distibution is
updated for the next iteration.  As desired, examples that are
correctly classified (for which $\VARm{y_n} \VARm{\hat y_n} = +1$)
have their weight \emph{decreased} multiplicatively.  Examples that
are incorrectly classified ($\VARm{y_n} \VARm{\hat y_n} = -1$) have
their weight \emph{increased} multiplicatively.  The $\VARm{Z}$ term
is a nomralization constant to ensure that the sum of $\VARm{\vec d}$
is one (i.e., $\VARm{\vec d}$ can be interpreted as a distribution).
The final classifier returned by AdaBoost is a weighted vote of the
individual classifiers, with weights given by the adaptive parameters.

To better understand why $\al$ is defined as it is, suppose that our
weak learner simply returns a \emph{constant} function that returns
the (weighted) majority class.  So if the total weight of positive
examples exceeds that of negative examples, $f(\vx) = +1$ for all
$\vx$; otherwise $f(\vx) = -1$ for all $\vx$.  To make the problem
moderately interesting, suppose that in the original training set,
there are $80$ positive examples and $20$ negative examples.  In this
case, $f\oth(\vx)=+1$.  It's weighted error rate will be $\hat\ep\oth
= 0.2$ because it gets every negative example wrong.  Computing, we
get $\al\oth = \frac12\log 4$.  Before normalization, we get the new
weight for each positive (correct) example to be $1 \exp[-\frac12\log
4] = \frac12$.  The weight for each negative (incorrect) example
becomes $1 \exp[\frac12\log 4] = 2$.  We can compute $Z = 80 \times
\frac 1 2 + 20 \times 2 = 80$.  Therefore, after normalization, the
weight distribution on any single positive example is $\frac 1 {160}$
and the weight on any negative example is $\frac 1 {40}$.  However,
since there are $80$ positive examples and $20$ negative examples, the
\emph{cumulative} weight on all positive examples is $80 \times \frac
1 {160} = \frac 1 2$; the cumulative weight on all negative examples
is $20 \times \frac 1{40} = \frac12$.  Thus, after a single boosting
iteration, the data has become precisely evenly weighted.  This
guarantees that in the next iteration, our weak learner \emph{must} do
something more interesting than majority voting if it is to achieve an
error rate \emph{less than} $50\%$, as required.

\thinkaboutit{This example uses concrete numbers, but the same result
  holds no matter what the data distribution looks like nor how many
  examples there are.  Write out the general case to see that you will
  still arrive at an even weighting after one iteration.}

\Figure{ens_boost}{perf comparison of depth vs \# boost}

One of the major attractions of boosting is that it is perhaps easy to
design computationally efficient weak learners.  A very popular type
of weak learner is a \concept{shallow decision tree}: a decision tree
with a small depth limit.  Figure~\ref{fig:ens_boost} shows test error
rates for decision trees of different maximum depths (the different
curves) run for differing numbers of boosting iterations (the
x-axis).  As you can see, if you are willing to boost for many
iterations, very shallow trees are quite effective.

In fact, a very popular weak learner is a decision \concept{decision
  stump}: a decision tree that can only ask \emph{one} question.  This
may seem like a silly model (and, in fact, it is on it's own), but
when combined with boosting, it becomes very effective.  To understand
why, suppose for a moment that our data consists only of binary
features, so that any question that a decision tree might ask is of
the form ``is feature 5 on?''  By concentrating on decision stumps,
all weak functions must have the form $f(\vx) = s (2 x_d - 1)$, where
$s \in \{\pm 1\}$ and $d$ indexes \emph{some} feature.

\thinkaboutit{Why do the functions have this form?}

Now, consider the \emph{final} form of a function learned by
AdaBoost.  We can expand it as follow, where we let $f_k$ denote the
single feature selected by the $k$th decision stump and let $s_k$
denote its sign:
%
\begin{align}
f(\vx) 
&= \sgn\left[ \sum_k \al_k f\kth(\vx) \right] \\
&= \sgn\left[ \sum_k \al_k s_k (2 x_{f_k} - 1) \right] \\
&= \sgn\left[ \sum_k 2 \al_k s_k x_{f_k} - \sum_k \al_k s_k \right] \\
&= \sgn\left[ \dotp{\vw}{\vx} + b \right] \\
& \text{where }
w_d = \sum_{k : f_k=d} 2 \al_k s_k \quad \text{and} \quad
b   = - \sum_k \al_k s_k
\end{align}
%
Thus, when working with decision stumps, AdaBoost actually provides an
algorithm for learning \concept{linear classifiers}!  In fact, this
connection has recently been strengthened: you can show that AdaBoost
provides an algorithm for optimizing \concept{exponential loss}.
(However, this connection is beyond the scope of this book.)

As a further example, consider the case of boosting a \concept{linear
  classifier}.  In this case, if we let the $k$th weak classifier be
parameterized by $\vw\kth$ and $b\kth$, the overall predictor will
have the form:
%
\begin{align}
f(\vx)
&= \sgn\left[ \sum_k \al_k \sgn\left( \dotp{\vw\kth}{\vx}+b\kth \right) \right]
\end{align}
%
You can notice that this is nothing but a two-layer \concept{neural
  network}, with $K$-many hidden units!  Of course it's not a
classifically trained neural network (once you learn $\vw\kth$ you
never go back and update it), but the structure is identical.

\section{Random Ensembles}

One of the most computationally expensive aspects of ensembles of
decision trees is training the decision trees.  This is very fast for
decision stumps, but for deeper trees it can be prohibitively
expensive.  The expensive part is choosing the tree structure.  Once
the tree structure is chosen, it is very cheap to fill in the leaves
(i.e., the predictions of the trees) using the training data.

An efficient and surprisingly effective alternative is to use trees
with fixed structures and random features.  Collections of trees are
called forests, and so classifiers built like this are called
\concept{random forests}.  The random forest training algorithm, shown
in Algorithm~\ref{alg:ens:randomforest} is quite short.  It takes
three arguments: the data, a desired depth of the decision trees, and
a number $K$ of total decision trees to build.

\newalgorithm{ens:randomforest}%
  {\FUN{RandomForestTrain}(\VAR{$\cD$}, \VAR{depth}, \VAR{$K$})}%
  {
\FOR{\VAR{$k$} = \CON 1 \dots \VAR{$K$}}
\SETST{$t\kth$}{complete binary tree of depth \VAR{depth} with random
  feature splits}
\SETST{$f\kth$}{the function computed by \VAR{$t\kth$}, with leaves
  filled in by \VAR{$\cD$}}
\ENDFOR
\RETURN $\FUNm{f}(\VARm{\hat \vx}) = \sgn\left[ \sum_k \FUNm{f\kth}(\VARm{\hat\vx}) \right]$
  \COMMENT{Return voted classifier}
}

The algorithm generates each of the $K$ trees independently, which
makes it very easy to parallelize.  For each trees, it constructs a
full binary tree of depth \VAR{depth}.  The features used at the
branches of this tree are selected randomly, typically \emph{with
  replacement}, meaning that the same feature can appear multiple
times, even in one branch.  The leaves of this tree, where predictions
are made, are filled in based on the training data.  This last step is
the \emph{only} point at which the training data is used.  The
resulting classifier is then just a voting of the $K$-many random
trees.

The most amazing thing about this approach is that it actually works
remarkably well.  It tends to work best when all of the features are
at least marginally relevant, since the number of features selected
for any given tree is small.  An intuitive reason that it works well
is the following.  Some of the trees will query on useless features.
These trees will essentially make random predictions.  But some of the
trees will happen to query on good features and will make good
predictions (because the leaves are estimated based on the training
data).  If you have enough trees, the random ones will wash out as
noise, and only the good trees will have an effect on the final
classification.
