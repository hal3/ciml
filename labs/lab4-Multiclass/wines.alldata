5	41 % from four different dutton ranches , 32 % martinelli , 14 % king , 11 % rochioli vineyards , and 2 % from green pastures ( a 40-year-old wente vineyard back felta creek road ) . a slightly warmer climate compared with our more coastal sites results in an earlier harvest from these vineyards and a somewhat richer texture and flavor .
